	abstract = {The neutrino floor is a theoretical lower limit on WIMP-like dark matter models that are discoverable in direct detection experiments. It is commonly interpreted as the point at which dark matter signals become hidden underneath a remarkably similar-looking background from neutrinos. However, it has been known for some time that the neutrino floor is not a hard limit, but can be pushed past with sufficient statistics. As a consequence, some have recently advocated for calling it the "neutrino fog" instead. The downside of current methods of deriving the neutrino floor are that they rely on arbitrary choices of experimental exposure and energy threshold. Here we propose to define the neutrino floor as the boundary of the neutrino fog, and develop a calculation free from these assumptions. The technique is based on the derivative of a hypothetical experimental discovery limit as a function of exposure, and leads to a neutrino floor that is only influenced by the systematic uncertainties on the neutrino flux normalisations. Our floor is broadly similar to those found in the literature, but differs by almost an order of magnitude in the sub-GeV range, and above 20{\textasciitilde}GeV.},

	abstract = {The measurements of coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CEνNS) experiments have opened up the possibility to constrain neutrino physics beyond the standard model of elementary particle physics. Furthermore, by considering neutrinoelectron scattering in the keV-energy region, it is possible to set additional limits on new physics processes. Here, we present constraints that are derived from Conus germanium data on beyond the standard model (BSM) processes like tensor and vector non-standard interactions (NSIs) in the neutrino-quark sector, as well as light vector and scalar mediators. Thanks to the realized low background levels in the Conus experiment at ionization energies below 1 keV, we are able to set the world’s best limits on tensor NSIs from CEνNS and constrain the scale of corresponding new physics to lie above 360 GeV. For vector NSIs, the derived limits strongly depend on the assumed ionization quenching factor within the detector material, since small quenching factors largely suppress potential signals for both, the expected standard model CEνNS process and the vector NSIs. Furthermore, competitive limits on scalar and vector mediators are obtained from the CEνNS channel at reactor-site which allow to probe coupling constants as low as 5 · 10−5 of low mediator masses, assuming the currently favored quenching factor regime. The consideration of neutrino-electron scatterings allows to set even stronger constraints for mediator masses below ∼ 1 MeV and ∼ 10 MeV for scalar and vector mediators, respectively.},

	abstract = {A comprehensive model for explaining scintillation yield in liquid xenon is introduced. We unify various definitions of work function which abound in the literature and incorporate all available data on electron recoil scintillation yield. This results in a better understanding of electron recoil, and facilitates an improved description of nuclear recoil. An incident gamma energy range of O(1 {keV}) to O(1 {MeV}) and electric fields between 0 and O(10 {kV}/cm) are incorporated into this heuristic model. We show results from a Geant4 implementation, but because the model has a few free parameters, implementation in any simulation package should be simple. We use a quasi-empirical approach, with an objective of improving detector calibrations and performance verification. The model will aid in the design and optimization of future detectors. This model is also easy to extend to other noble elements. In this paper we lay the foundation for an exhaustive simulation code which we call {NEST} (Noble Element Simulation Technique).},

	abstract = {We present an updated model of light and charge yields from nuclear recoils in liquid xenon with a simultaneously constrained parameter set. A global analysis is performed using measurements of electron and photon yields compiled from all available historical data, as well as measurements of the ratio of the two. These data sweep over energies from 1 - 300 {keV} and external applied electric fields from 0 - 4060 V/cm. The model is constrained by constructing global cost functions and using a gradient descent minimizer, a simulated annealing algorithm, and a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach to optimize and find confidence intervals on all free parameters in the model. This analysis contrasts with previous work in that we do not unnecessarily exclude data sets nor impose artificially conservative assumptions, do not use spline functions, and reduce the number of parameters used in {NEST} v0.98. We report our results and the calculated best-fit charge and light yields. These quantities are crucial to understanding the response of liquid xenon detectors in the energy regime important for rare event searches such as the direct detection of dark matter particles.},

We present results from a 10 cm diameter GPM coupled to a dual-phase liquid xenon (LXe) TPC, demonstrating - for the first time - the feasibility of recording both primary ("S1") and secondary ("S2") scintillation signals. The detector comprised a triple Thick Gas Electron Multiplier (THGEM) structure with cesium iodide photocathode on the first element; it was shown to operate stably at 180 K with gains above 10{\textasciicircum}5, providing high single-photon detection efficiency even in the presence of large alpha particle-induced S2 signals comprising thousands of photoelectrons. S1 scintillation signals were recorded with a time resolution of 1.2 ns (RMS). The energy resolution (\{{\textbackslash}sigma\}/E) for S2 electroluminescence of 5.5 MeV alpha particles was {\textasciitilde}9\%, which is comparable to that obtained in the XENON100 TPC with PMTs. The results are discussed within the context of potential GPM deployment in future multi-ton noble-liquid detectors.},

	abstract = {We present the precision calibration of 35 Hamamatsu R11410-22 photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) with xenon scintillation light centred near 175 nm. This particular PMT variant was developed specifically for the LUX-ZEPLIN (LZ) dark matter experiment. A room-temperature xenon scintillation cell coupled to a vacuum cryostat was used to study the full-face PMT response at both room and low temperature \${\textbackslash}textrm\{(\${\textbackslash}sim\$ -100\${\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ\$C)\}\$, in particular to determine the quantum efficiency (QE) and double photoelectron emission (DPE) probability in LZ operating conditions. For our sample with an average QE of \${\textbackslash}textrm\{(32.4\${\textbackslash}pm\$2.9)\%\}\$ at room temperature, we find a relative improvement of \${\textbackslash}textrm\{(17.9\${\textbackslash}pm\$5.2)\%\}\$ upon cooling (where uncertainty values refer to the sample standard deviation). The mean DPE probability in response to single vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) photons is \${\textbackslash}textrm\{(22.6\${\textbackslash}pm\$2.0)\%\}\$ at low temperature; the DPE increase relative to room temperature, measured here for the first time, was \${\textbackslash}textrm\{(12.2\${\textbackslash}pm\$3.9)\%\}\$. Evidence of a small triple photoelectron emission probability \${\textbackslash}textrm\{(\${\textbackslash}sim\$0.6\%)\}\$ has also been observed. Useful correlations are established between these parameters and the QE as measured by the manufacturer. The single VUV photon response is also measured for one ETEL D730/9829QB, a PMT with a more standard bialkali photocathode used in the ZEPLIN-III experiment, for which we obtained a cold DPE fraction of \${\textbackslash}textrm\{(9.1\${\textbackslash}pm\$0.1)\%\}\$. Hence, we confirm that this effect is not restricted to the low-temperature bialkali photocathode technology employed by Hamamatsu. This highlights the importance of considering this phenomenon in the interpretation of data from liquid xenon scintillation and electroluminescence detectors, and from many other optical measurements in this wavelength region.},

A precise measurement of the cosmic-ray background would play an essential role in proceeding with the R{\textbackslash}\&D research for these MeV-scale neutrino experiments. Using a 1-ton prototype detector for the Jinping Neutrino Experiment (JNE), we detected 264 high-energy muon events from a 645.2-day dataset at the first phase of CJPL (CJPL-I), reconstructed their directions, and measured the cosmic-ray muon flux to be \$(3.53{\textbackslash}pm0.22\_\{{\textbackslash}text\{stat.\}\}{\textbackslash}pm0.07\_\{{\textbackslash}text\{sys.\}\}){\textbackslash}times10{\textasciicircum}\{-10\}\$ cm\${\textasciicircum}\{-2\}\$s\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$. The observed angular distributions indicate the leakage of cosmic-ray muon background and agree with the simulation accounting for Jinping mountain's terrain. A survey of muon fluxes at different laboratory locations situated under mountains and below mine shaft indicated that the former is generally a factor of \$(4{\textbackslash}pm2)\$ larger than the latter with the same vertical overburden. This study provides a convenient back-of-the-envelope estimation for muon flux of an underground experiment.},
