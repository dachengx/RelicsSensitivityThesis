	abstract = {The neutrino floor is a theoretical lower limit on WIMP-like dark matter models that are discoverable in direct detection experiments. It is commonly interpreted as the point at which dark matter signals become hidden underneath a remarkably similar-looking background from neutrinos. However, it has been known for some time that the neutrino floor is not a hard limit, but can be pushed past with sufficient statistics. As a consequence, some have recently advocated for calling it the "neutrino fog" instead. The downside of current methods of deriving the neutrino floor are that they rely on arbitrary choices of experimental exposure and energy threshold. Here we propose to define the neutrino floor as the boundary of the neutrino fog, and develop a calculation free from these assumptions. The technique is based on the derivative of a hypothetical experimental discovery limit as a function of exposure, and leads to a neutrino floor that is only influenced by the systematic uncertainties on the neutrino flux normalisations. Our floor is broadly similar to those found in the literature, but differs by almost an order of magnitude in the sub-GeV range, and above 20{\textasciitilde}GeV.},

	abstract = {The measurements of coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CEνNS) experiments have opened up the possibility to constrain neutrino physics beyond the standard model of elementary particle physics. Furthermore, by considering neutrinoelectron scattering in the keV-energy region, it is possible to set additional limits on new physics processes. Here, we present constraints that are derived from Conus germanium data on beyond the standard model (BSM) processes like tensor and vector non-standard interactions (NSIs) in the neutrino-quark sector, as well as light vector and scalar mediators. Thanks to the realized low background levels in the Conus experiment at ionization energies below 1 keV, we are able to set the world’s best limits on tensor NSIs from CEνNS and constrain the scale of corresponding new physics to lie above 360 GeV. For vector NSIs, the derived limits strongly depend on the assumed ionization quenching factor within the detector material, since small quenching factors largely suppress potential signals for both, the expected standard model CEνNS process and the vector NSIs. Furthermore, competitive limits on scalar and vector mediators are obtained from the CEνNS channel at reactor-site which allow to probe coupling constants as low as 5 · 10−5 of low mediator masses, assuming the currently favored quenching factor regime. The consideration of neutrino-electron scatterings allows to set even stronger constraints for mediator masses below ∼ 1 MeV and ∼ 10 MeV for scalar and vector mediators, respectively.},

	abstract = {A comprehensive model for explaining scintillation yield in liquid xenon is introduced. We unify various definitions of work function which abound in the literature and incorporate all available data on electron recoil scintillation yield. This results in a better understanding of electron recoil, and facilitates an improved description of nuclear recoil. An incident gamma energy range of O(1 {keV}) to O(1 {MeV}) and electric fields between 0 and O(10 {kV}/cm) are incorporated into this heuristic model. We show results from a Geant4 implementation, but because the model has a few free parameters, implementation in any simulation package should be simple. We use a quasi-empirical approach, with an objective of improving detector calibrations and performance verification. The model will aid in the design and optimization of future detectors. This model is also easy to extend to other noble elements. In this paper we lay the foundation for an exhaustive simulation code which we call {NEST} (Noble Element Simulation Technique).},

	abstract = {We present an updated model of light and charge yields from nuclear recoils in liquid xenon with a simultaneously constrained parameter set. A global analysis is performed using measurements of electron and photon yields compiled from all available historical data, as well as measurements of the ratio of the two. These data sweep over energies from 1 - 300 {keV} and external applied electric fields from 0 - 4060 V/cm. The model is constrained by constructing global cost functions and using a gradient descent minimizer, a simulated annealing algorithm, and a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach to optimize and find confidence intervals on all free parameters in the model. This analysis contrasts with previous work in that we do not unnecessarily exclude data sets nor impose artificially conservative assumptions, do not use spline functions, and reduce the number of parameters used in {NEST} v0.98. We report our results and the calculated best-fit charge and light yields. These quantities are crucial to understanding the response of liquid xenon detectors in the energy regime important for rare event searches such as the direct detection of dark matter particles.},

We present results from a 10 cm diameter GPM coupled to a dual-phase liquid xenon (LXe) TPC, demonstrating - for the first time - the feasibility of recording both primary ("S1") and secondary ("S2") scintillation signals. The detector comprised a triple Thick Gas Electron Multiplier (THGEM) structure with cesium iodide photocathode on the first element; it was shown to operate stably at 180 K with gains above 10{\textasciicircum}5, providing high single-photon detection efficiency even in the presence of large alpha particle-induced S2 signals comprising thousands of photoelectrons. S1 scintillation signals were recorded with a time resolution of 1.2 ns (RMS). The energy resolution (\{{\textbackslash}sigma\}/E) for S2 electroluminescence of 5.5 MeV alpha particles was {\textasciitilde}9\%, which is comparable to that obtained in the XENON100 TPC with PMTs. The results are discussed within the context of potential GPM deployment in future multi-ton noble-liquid detectors.},

	abstract = {We present the precision calibration of 35 Hamamatsu R11410-22 photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) with xenon scintillation light centred near 175 nm. This particular PMT variant was developed specifically for the LUX-ZEPLIN (LZ) dark matter experiment. A room-temperature xenon scintillation cell coupled to a vacuum cryostat was used to study the full-face PMT response at both room and low temperature \${\textbackslash}textrm\{(\${\textbackslash}sim\$ -100\${\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ\$C)\}\$, in particular to determine the quantum efficiency (QE) and double photoelectron emission (DPE) probability in LZ operating conditions. For our sample with an average QE of \${\textbackslash}textrm\{(32.4\${\textbackslash}pm\$2.9)\%\}\$ at room temperature, we find a relative improvement of \${\textbackslash}textrm\{(17.9\${\textbackslash}pm\$5.2)\%\}\$ upon cooling (where uncertainty values refer to the sample standard deviation). The mean DPE probability in response to single vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) photons is \${\textbackslash}textrm\{(22.6\${\textbackslash}pm\$2.0)\%\}\$ at low temperature; the DPE increase relative to room temperature, measured here for the first time, was \${\textbackslash}textrm\{(12.2\${\textbackslash}pm\$3.9)\%\}\$. Evidence of a small triple photoelectron emission probability \${\textbackslash}textrm\{(\${\textbackslash}sim\$0.6\%)\}\$ has also been observed. Useful correlations are established between these parameters and the QE as measured by the manufacturer. The single VUV photon response is also measured for one ETEL D730/9829QB, a PMT with a more standard bialkali photocathode used in the ZEPLIN-III experiment, for which we obtained a cold DPE fraction of \${\textbackslash}textrm\{(9.1\${\textbackslash}pm\$0.1)\%\}\$. Hence, we confirm that this effect is not restricted to the low-temperature bialkali photocathode technology employed by Hamamatsu. This highlights the importance of considering this phenomenon in the interpretation of data from liquid xenon scintillation and electroluminescence detectors, and from many other optical measurements in this wavelength region.},

A precise measurement of the cosmic-ray background would play an essential role in proceeding with the R{\textbackslash}\&D research for these MeV-scale neutrino experiments. Using a 1-ton prototype detector for the Jinping Neutrino Experiment (JNE), we detected 264 high-energy muon events from a 645.2-day dataset at the first phase of CJPL (CJPL-I), reconstructed their directions, and measured the cosmic-ray muon flux to be \$(3.53{\textbackslash}pm0.22\_\{{\textbackslash}text\{stat.\}\}{\textbackslash}pm0.07\_\{{\textbackslash}text\{sys.\}\}){\textbackslash}times10{\textasciicircum}\{-10\}\$ cm\${\textasciicircum}\{-2\}\$s\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$. The observed angular distributions indicate the leakage of cosmic-ray muon background and agree with the simulation accounting for Jinping mountain's terrain. A survey of muon fluxes at different laboratory locations situated under mountains and below mine shaft indicated that the former is generally a factor of \$(4{\textbackslash}pm2)\$ larger than the latter with the same vertical overburden. This study provides a convenient back-of-the-envelope estimation for muon flux of an underground experiment.},

The photoelectron yield is about 4500 per MeV, an order higher than any existing large-scale liquid scintillator detectors. The detector operates at -50 degree C to lower the dark noise of SiPMs to an acceptable level.

The antineutrinos were generated by six 2.9{\textasciitilde}GW\$\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{th\}\}\$ nuclear reactors and detected by eight antineutrino detectors deployed in two near (560{\textasciitilde}m and 600{\textasciitilde}m flux-weighted baselines) and one far (1640{\textasciitilde}m flux-weighted baseline) underground experimental halls. With 621 days of data, more than 1.2 million inverse beta decay (IBD) candidates were detected. The IBD yield in the eight detectors was measured, and the ratio of measured to predicted flux was found to be \$0.946{\textbackslash}pm0.020\$ (\$0.992{\textbackslash}pm0.021\$) for the Huber+Mueller (ILL+Vogel) model. A 2.9{\textasciitilde}\${\textbackslash}sigma\$ deviation was found in the measured IBD positron energy spectrum compared to the predictions.

	abstract = {In this paper we study the effect of well-known higher-order corrections to the allowed β-decay spectrum on the determination of antineutrino spectra resulting from the decays of fission fragments. In particular, we try to estimate the associated theory errors and find that induced currents like weak magnetism may ultimately limit our ability to improve the current accuracy and under certain circumstance could even greatly increase the theoretical errors. We also perform a critical evaluation of the errors associated with our method to extract the antineutrino spectrum using synthetic β spectra. It turns out that a fit using only virtual β branches with a judicious choice of the effective nuclear charge provides results with a minimal bias. We apply this method to actual data for 235U, 239Pu, and 241Pu and confirm, within errors, recent results, which indicate a net 3\% upward shift in energy-averaged antineutrino fluxes. However, we also find significant shape differences which can, in principle, be tested by high-statistics antineutrino data samples., This article appears in the following collection:},

	abstract = {We report new calculations of reactor antineutrino spectra including the latest information from nuclear databases and a detailed error budget. The first part of this work is the so-called ab initio approach where the total antineutrino spectrum is built from the sum of all beta-branches of all fission products predicted by an evolution code. Systematic effects and missing information in nuclear databases lead to final relative uncertainties in the 10 to 20\% range. A prediction of the antineutrino spectrum associated with the fission of 238U is given based on this ab initio method. For the dominant isotopes 235U and 239Pu, we developed a more accurate approach combining information from nuclear databases and reference electron spectra associated with the fission of 235U, 239Pu and 241Pu, measured at ILL in the 80's. We show how the anchor point of the measured total beta-spectra can be used to suppress the uncertainty in nuclear databases while taking advantage of all the information they contain. We provide new reference antineutrino spectra for 235U, 239Pu and 241Pu isotopes in the 2-8 MeV range. While the shapes of the spectra and their uncertainties are comparable to that of the previous analysis of the ILL data, the normalization is shifted by about +3\% on average. In the perspective of the re-analysis of past experiments and direct use of these results by upcoming oscillation experiments, we discuss the various sources of errors and their correlations as well as the corrections induced by off equilibrium effects.},

It is useful to improve the precision of the thermal fission energy calculation for current and future reactor neutrino experiments, which are aimed at more precise determination of neutrino oscillation parameters. In this article, we give new values for thermal fission energies of some common thermal reactor fuel isotopes, with improvements on three aspects. One is more recent input data acquired from updated nuclear databases. the second one is a consideration of the production yields of fission fragments from both thermal and fast incident neutrons for each of the four main fuel isotopes. The last one is more carefully calculation of the average energy taken away by antineutrinos in thermal fission with the comparison of antineutrino spectrum from different models. The change in calculated antineutrino flux due to the new values of thermal fission energy is about 0.32\%, and the uncertainties of the new values are about 50\% smaller.},

	abstract = {The Daya Bay experiment has observed correlations between reactor core fuel evolution and changes in the reactor antineutrino flux and energy spectrum. Four antineutrino detectors in two experimental halls were used to identify 2.2 million inverse beta decays (IBDs) over 1230 days spanning multiple fuel cycles for each of six 2.9 GW\$\_\{{\textbackslash}textrm\{th\}\}\$ reactor cores at the Daya Bay and Ling Ao nuclear power plants. Using detector data spanning effective \${\textasciicircum}\{239\}\$Pu fission fractions, \$F\_\{239\}\$, from 0.25 to 0.35, Daya Bay measures an average IBD yield, \${\textbackslash}bar\{{\textbackslash}sigma\}\_f\$, of \$(5.90 {\textbackslash}pm 0.13) {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{-43\}\$ cm\${\textasciicircum}2\$/fission and a fuel-dependent variation in the IBD yield, \$d{\textbackslash}sigma\_f/dF\_\{239\}\$, of \$(-1.86 {\textbackslash}pm 0.18) {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{-43\}\$ cm\${\textasciicircum}2\$/fission. This observation rejects the hypothesis of a constant antineutrino flux as a function of the \${\textasciicircum}\{239\}\$Pu fission fraction at 10 standard deviations. The variation in IBD yield was found to be energy-dependent, rejecting the hypothesis of a constant antineutrino energy spectrum at 5.1 standard deviations. While measurements of the evolution in the IBD spectrum show general agreement with predictions from recent reactor models, the measured evolution in total IBD yield disagrees with recent predictions at 3.1\${\textbackslash}sigma\$. This discrepancy indicates that an overall deficit in measured flux with respect to predictions does not result from equal fractional deficits from the primary fission isotopes \${\textasciicircum}\{235\}\$U, \${\textasciicircum}\{239\}\$Pu, \${\textasciicircum}\{238\}\$U, and \${\textasciicircum}\{241\}\$Pu.

A 7.8\% discrepancy between the observed and predicted \${\textasciicircum}\{235\}\$U yield suggests that this isotope may be the primary contributor to the reactor antineutrino anomaly.},

We summarize searches for hypothetical particles such as supersymmetric particles, heavy bosons, axions, dark photons, etc. All the particle properties and search limits are listed in Summary Tables. We also give numerous tables, figures, formulae, and reviews of topics such as Higgs Boson Physics, Supersymmetry, Grand Unified Theories, Neutrino Mixing, Dark Energy, Dark Matter, Cosmology, Particle Detectors, Colliders, Probability and Statistics. Among the 117 reviews are many that are new or heavily revised, including those on Pentaquarks and Inflation. The complete Review is published online in a journal and on the website of the Particle Data Group (http://pdg.lbl.gov). The printed {PDG} Book contains the Summary Tables and all review articles but no longer includes the detailed tables from the Particle Listings.

	abstract = {A fair knowledge of the atmospheric muon distributions at Earth is a prerequisite for the simulations of cosmic ray setups and rare event search detectors. A modified power law is proposed for atmospheric muon energy distribution which gives a good description of the cosmic muon data in low as well as high energy regime. Using this distribution, analytical forms for zenith angle (\${\textbackslash}theta\$) distribution are obtained. Assuming a flat Earth, it leads to the \${\textbackslash}cos{\textasciicircum}\{n-1\}{\textbackslash}theta\$ form where it is shown that the parameter \$n\$ is nothing but the power of the energy distribution. Exact analytical function is obtained for inclined trajectory of muon. A new closed form for zenith angle distribution is obtained without assuming a flat Earth and which gives an improved description of the data at all angles even above \$70{\textasciicircum}o\$. These distributions are tested with the available atmospheric muon data of energy and angular distributions. The parameters of these distributions can be used to characterize the cosmic muon data as a function of energy, angle and altitude.},

In this technical correspondence, we want to point out some inaccuracies in the way DBSCAN was represented, and why the criticism should have been directed at the assumption about the performance of spatial index structures such as R-trees and not at an algorithm that can use such indexes. We will also discuss the relationship of DBSCAN performance and the indexability of the dataset, and discuss some heuristics for choosing appropriate DBSCAN parameters. Some indicators of bad parameters will be proposed to help guide future users of this algorithm in choosing parameters such as to obtain both meaningful results and good performance. In new experiments, we show that the new SIGMOD 2015 methods do not appear to offer practical benefits if the DBSCAN parameters are well chosen and thus they are primarily of theoretical interest. In conclusion, the original DBSCAN algorithm with effective indexes and reasonably chosen parameter values performs competitively compared to the method proposed by Gan and Tao.},

	abstract = {Clustering algorithms are attractive for the task of class identification in spatial databases. However, the application to large spatial databases rises the following requirements for clustering algorithms: minimal requirements of domain knowledge to determine the input parameters, discovery of clusters with arbitrary shape and good efficiency on large databases. The well-known clustering algorithms offer no solution to the combination of these requirements. In this paper, we present the new clustering algorithm DBSCAN relying on a density-based notion of clusters which is designed to discover clusters of arbitrary shape. DBSCAN requires only one input parameter and supports the user in determining an appropriate value for it. We performed an experimental evaluation of the effectiveness and efficiency of DBSCAN using synthetic data and real data of the SEQUOIA 2000 benchmark. The results of our experiments demonstrate that (1) DBSCAN is significantly more effective in discovering clusters of arbitrary shape than the well-known algorithm CLAR-ANS, and that (2) DBSCAN outperforms CLARANS by a factor of more than 100 in terms of efficiency.},

	abstract = {The XENON100 experiment, located at the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso (LNGS), aims to directly detect dark matter in the form of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) via their elastic scattering off xenon nuclei. We present a comprehensive study of the predicted electronic recoil background coming from radioactive decays inside the detector and shield materials, and intrinsic contamination. Based on GEANT4 Monte Carlo simulations using a detailed geometry together with the measured radioactivity of all detector components, we predict an electronic recoil background in the WIMP-search energy range (0-100 keV) in the 30 kg fiducial mass of less than 10e-2 events/(kg-day-keV), consistent with the experiment's design goal. The predicted background spectrum is in very good agreement with the data taken during the commissioning of the detector, in Fall 2009.},

	abstract = {{XENONnT} is a dark matter direct detection experiment, utilizing 5.9 t of instrumented liquid xenon, located at the {INFN} Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso. In this work, we predict the experimental background and project the sensitivity of {XENONnT} to the detection of weakly interacting massive particles ({WIMPs}). The expected average differential background rate in the energy region of interest, corresponding to (1, 13) {keV} and (4, 50) {keV} for electronic and nuclear recoils, amounts to \$12.3 {\textbackslash}pm 0.6\$ ({keV} t y)\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ and \$(2.2{\textbackslash}pm 0.5){\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{-3\}\$ ({keV} t y)\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$, respectively, in a 4 t fiducial mass. We compute unified confidence intervals using the profile construction method, in order to ensure proper coverage. With the exposure goal of 20 t\${\textbackslash},\$y, the expected sensitivity to spin-independent {WIMP}-nucleon interactions reaches a cross-section of \$1.4{\textbackslash}times10{\textasciicircum}\{-48\}\$ cm\${\textasciicircum}2\$ for a 50 {GeV}/c\${\textasciicircum}2\$ mass {WIMP} at 90\% confidence level, more than one order of magnitude beyond the current best limit, set by {XENON}1T. In addition, we show that for a 50 {GeV}/c\${\textasciicircum}2\$ {WIMP} with cross-sections above \$2.6{\textbackslash}times10{\textasciicircum}\{-48\}\$ cm\${\textasciicircum}2\$ (\$5.0{\textbackslash}times10{\textasciicircum}\{-48\}\$ cm\${\textasciicircum}2\$) the median {XENONnT} discovery significance exceeds 3\${\textbackslash}sigma\$ (5\${\textbackslash}sigma\$). The expected sensitivity to the spin-dependent {WIMP} coupling to neutrons (protons) reaches \$2.2{\textbackslash}times10{\textasciicircum}\{-43\}\$ cm\${\textasciicircum}2\$ (\$6.0{\textbackslash}times10{\textasciicircum}\{-42\}\$ cm\${\textasciicircum}2\$).},

	abstract = {The Review summarizes much of particle physics and cosmology. Using data from previous editions, plus 3,324 new measurements from 878 papers, we list, evaluate, and average measured properties of gauge bosons and the recently discovered Higgs boson, leptons, quarks, mesons, and baryons. We summarize searches for hypothetical particles such as supersymmetric particles, heavy bosons, axions, dark photons, etc. Particle properties and search limits are listed in Summary Tables. We give numerous tables, figures, formulae, and reviews of topics such as Higgs Boson Physics, Supersymmetry, Grand Unified Theories, Neutrino Mixing, Dark Energy, Dark Matter, Cosmology, Particle Detectors, Colliders, Probability and Statistics. Among the 120 reviews are many that are new or heavily revised, including a new review on High Energy Soft {QCD} and Diffraction and one on the Determination of {CKM} Angles from B Hadrons.The Review is divided into two volumes. Volume 1 includes the Summary Tables and 98 review articles. Volume 2 consists of the Particle Listings and contains also 22 reviews that address specific aspects of the data presented in the Listings.The complete Review (both volumes) is published online on the website of the Particle Data Group (pdg.lbl.gov) and in a journal. Volume 1 is available in print as the {PDG} Book. A Particle Physics Booklet with the Summary Tables and essential tables, figures, and equations from selected review articles is available in print and as a web version optimized for use on phones as well as an Android app.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.05381},
	abstract = {The Large Underground Xenon ({LUX}) experiment is a dual-phase liquid xenon time projection chamber ({TPC}) operating at the Sanford Underground Research Facility in Lead, South Dakota. A calibration of nuclear recoils in liquid xenon was performed \${\textbackslash}textit\{in situ\}\$ in the {LUX} detector using a collimated beam of mono-energetic 2.45 {MeV} neutrons produced by a deuterium-deuterium (D-D) fusion source. The nuclear recoil energy from the first neutron scatter in the {TPC} was reconstructed using the measured scattering angle defined by double-scatter neutron events within the active xenon volume. We measured the absolute charge (\$Q\_\{y\}\$) and light (\$L\_\{y\}\$) yields at an average electric field of 180 V/cm for nuclear recoil energies spanning 0.7 to 74 {keV} and 1.1 to 74 {keV}, respectively. This calibration of the nuclear recoil signal yields will permit the further refinement of liquid xenon nuclear recoil signal models and, importantly for dark matter searches, clearly demonstrates measured ionization and scintillation signals in this medium at recoil energies down to \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{O\}\$(1 {keV}).},
